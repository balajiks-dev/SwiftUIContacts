# SwiftUIContacts

Hey Crew,

This repo is the simple Contacts SwiftUI App which can add a new contact with FullName, MobileNumber, JobTitle and EmailId and also can be able to edit that contact.
All the contacts were viewed in a list.

In Later, I will upload with Coredata Feature in SwiftUI for this application.

Screenshots were added in the project file itself.
